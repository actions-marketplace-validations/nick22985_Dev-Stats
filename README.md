# Developer Stats
This project was based of the ðŸ“Œâœ¨Awesome Readme Stats. The reason I created this was to save github action time and reduce the over all run time of the stats. I hope to branch out and create something different to the orignal design eventually. If you want a feature request please make a Issue for it

## Setup
1. You will need to insert the injection points into your .md file in your profile readme. 
2. You will need a WakaTime API key
3. You will need a GitHub API Toekn with the `repo` & `user` scope
4. Save the WakaTime API key & Github API key into your repo secrets
5. Enable / disable feature flags bades on what you want your profile readme to look like
